# Lorentz - Experience Special Realitivity in VR

## Inspiration
Introducing our latest creation: a revolutionary VR experience that will change the way you learn and understand physics forever. Say goodbye to the counterintuitive and confusing nature of the Theory of Relativity, and hello to an immersive learning experience that will captivate your senses.

## What it does
Our team has developed a VR platform that allows you to experience the mind-bending effects of travelling at speeds close to the speed of light. Witness first-hand the fascinating phenomena of Lorentz contraction and the Doppler effect as you explore a world that defies traditional laws of physics. Our VR experience is the perfect way to gain intuition and truly understand the inner workings of one of the most fundamental theories of modern science. Are you ready to step into a world where time and space are no longer what they seem? Join us and experience the Theory of Relativity like never before.

Lorentz Contraction (world contracting when travelling near light speed):

## How we built it
Unity, Echo3D, Shader Programming, 
A LOT of Physics and Math

## Challenges we ran into
We struggled to understand Special Relativity before this hackathon even began.
Shader programming, Implementing vision delay due to the low speed of light

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning shader programming, Building a complete VR demo
Being able to visualize and understand Lorentz contraction and Doppler effect.

## What's next for Lorentz
Light aberration, Multiplayer experience using Echo3D Backend
Demonstrating pole vaulter experiment in this environment.
